# QSTP--Quark-Summer-Technical-Project-
This QSTP, Introduction to Android Application Development , gives students a
comprehensive overview of android app development using Android Studio . This course is aimed
at students who have had interest in app development and wish to learn the basics.
We begin with a basic revision of Java, and move on to the major focus of this course - app UI
components and in-app processing . This will give students a good start in this field and they can
then learn further, and be ready to take up any industry-grade app development project.
